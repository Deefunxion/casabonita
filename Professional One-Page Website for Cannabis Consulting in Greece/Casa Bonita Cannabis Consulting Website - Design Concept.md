# Casa Bonita Cannabis Consulting Website - Design Concept

## Visual Identity & Brand Direction

Casa Bonita represents a premium cannabis consulting service that embodies the Mediterranean growing culture of Greece. The brand positioning is sophisticated yet approachable, leveraging 25 years of expertise while maintaining a discreet, professional presence. The tagline "Grow Heroes" and slogan "Grow Like a Local Legend" capture the aspirational yet grounded nature of the service.

## Color Palette

Based on the natural earth tones and olive green aesthetic requirements, the primary color palette draws inspiration from the Mediterranean landscape:

**Primary Colors:**
- Deep Olive Green (#6B7A3F) - Primary brand color, representing mature cannabis leaves and Mediterranean vegetation
- Forest Green (#4A5D23) - Secondary green for depth and contrast
- Warm Cream (#F5F3E9) - Background and text contrast color

**Supporting Colors:**
- Rich Earth Brown (#8B6F47) - Accent color for soil and natural elements
- Sage Green (#9CAF88) - Light accent for highlights and subtle elements
- Charcoal Gray (#3A3A3A) - Primary text color for readability
- Soft Beige (#E8E2D4) - Secondary background for sections

## Typography

The typography approach emphasizes clean, minimal fonts that convey professionalism and expertise:

**Primary Font:** Inter or system fonts for maximum compatibility and fast loading
**Headings:** Bold weights (600-700) for strong hierarchy
**Body Text:** Regular weight (400) for optimal readability

## Design Principles

**Minimalism:** Clean layouts with plenty of white space, avoiding clutter and maintaining focus on key information.

**Natural Aesthetics:** Subtle use of plant textures and earth tones without being overwhelming or clich√©.

**Professional Discretion:** Sophisticated presentation that appeals to serious growers while maintaining appropriate discretion for the cannabis industry.

**Mobile-First:** Responsive design optimized for mobile devices, ensuring fast loading and easy navigation on all screen sizes.

**Performance:** No animations or heavy graphics that could slow loading times, focusing on clean CSS and optimized images.

## Content Strategy

The content approach balances expertise with accessibility, using confident but not hyperbolic language. References to local elements (Attica, Mediterranean climate, balcony growing) create authenticity and local relevance. The tone is friendly but expert, avoiding marketing buzzwords while clearly communicating value propositions.

Technical information is presented clearly without overwhelming beginners, while still demonstrating deep expertise for intermediate growers. The focus remains on practical solutions and proven results rather than theoretical knowledge.

## User Experience Flow

Visitors should immediately understand the premium nature of the service, the local expertise, and the comprehensive support offered. The progression from hero section through services to pricing creates a natural flow toward conversion, with multiple touchpoints for different user intentions (immediate consultation, learning about services, or pricing research).

The contact form placement at the bottom provides a natural conclusion to the information journey, while strategic CTA buttons throughout the page offer immediate action opportunities for ready prospects.
